`zeronet-conservancy` is a fork/continuation of [ZeroNet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) project
(that has been abandoned by its creator) that is dedicated to sustaining existing p2p network and developing
its values of decentralization and freedom, while gradually switching to a better designed network

## State of the fork

During onion-v3 switch crisis, we needed a fork that worked with onion-v3 and didn't depend on trust to one or
two people. This fork started from fulfilling that mission, implementing minimal changes to
[ZeroNet/py3](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/tree/py3) branch which are easy to audit by anyone.

Now 0net is in deeper crisis than ever before and this fork seems to
be the last one standing.  Development is sparse and slow, but some of
the work is being done behind the scenes. If you're completely new to
0net, don't have anybody to guide you there and are not a developer,
we recommend waiting until v0.8 is out.

## Why 0net?

* We believe in open, free, and uncensored networks and communication.
* No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is
  serving it.
* No hosting costs: Sites are served by visitors.
* Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere.
* Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is
  unavailable.


## Features
 * Real-time updated sites
 * Clone websites in one click
 * Password-less authorization using private/public keys
 * Built-in SQL server with P2P data synchronization: allows easier dynamic site development
 * Anonymity: Tor network support with .onion hidden services (including onion-v3 support)
 * TLS encrypted connections (through clearnet)
 * Automatic uPnP port opening (if opted in)
 * Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support
 * Works with any modern browser/OS
 * Works offline and can be synced via alternative transports (or when connection is back)


## How does it work?

* After starting `zeronet.py` you will be able to visit zeronet sites using
  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zeronet_address}` (eg.
  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MCoA8rQHhwu4LY2t2aabqcGSRqrL8uf2X/`).
* When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent
  network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.
* Each visited site is also served by you.
* Every site contains a `content.json` file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash
  and a signature generated using the site's private key.
* If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the
  site, then he/she signs the new `content.json` and publishes it to the peers.
  Afterwards, the peers verify the `content.json` integrity (using the
  signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to
  other peers.

## How to join

### Install from your distribution repository

- NixOS: [zeronet-conservancy packages search](https://search.nixos.org/packages?from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=zeronet-conservancy) (and see below)
- ArchLinux: [latest release](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zeronet-conservancy), [fresh git version](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zeronet-conservancy-git)

### Install from Nix package manager (Linux or MacOS)

 - install & configure nix package manager (if needed)
 - `nix-env -iA nixpkgs.zeronet-conservancy`

or add `zeronet-conservancy` to your system configuration if you're on NixOS

(thanks @fgaz for making & maintaining the package)

### Install from source

#### System dependencies

##### Generic unix-like (including mac os x)

Install autoconf and other basic development tools, python3 and pip, then proceed to "building python dependencies"
(if running fails due to missing dependency, please report it/make pull request to fix dependency list)

##### Apt-based (debian, ubuntu, etc)
 - `sudo apt update`
 - `sudo apt install git pkg-config libffi-dev python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev build-essential libtool`

##### Red Hat and Fedora based
 - `yum install epel-release -y 2>/dev/null`
 - `yum install git python3 python3-wheel`

##### Fedora based dandified
 - `sudo dnf install git python3-pip python3-wheel -y`

##### openSUSE
 - `sudo zypper install python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel`

##### Arch and Manjaro based
 - `sudo pacman -S git python-pip -v --no-confirm`

##### Android/Termux
 - install [Termux](https://termux.com/) (in Termux you can install packages via `pkg install <package-names>`)
 - `pkg update`
 - `pkg install python automake git binutils libtool`
 - (on an older android versions you may also need to install) `pkg install openssl-tool libcrypt clang`
 - (if you've installed the above packages and still run into launch issues, please report)
 - (optional) `pkg install tor`
 - (optional) run tor via `tor --ControlPort 9051 --CookieAuthentication 1` command (you can then open new session by swiping to the right)

#### Building python dependencies, venv & running
 - clone this repo (NOTE: on Android/Termux you should clone it into "home" folder of Termux, because virtual environment cannot live in `storage/`)
 - `python3 -m venv venv` (make python virtual environment, the last `venv` is just a name, if you use different you should replace it in later commands)
 - `source venv/bin/activate` (activate environment)
 - `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (install dependencies)
 - `python3 zeronet.py` (**run zeronet-conservancy!**)
 - open the landing page in your browser by navigating to: http://127.0.0.1:43110/
 - to start it again from fresh terminal, you need to navigate to repo directory and:
 - `source venv/bin/activate`
 - `python3 zeronet.py`

#### (alternatively) On NixOS
- clone this repo
- `nix-shell '<nixpkgs>' -A zeronet-conservancy` to enter shell with installed dependencies
- `./zeronet.py`

#### (alternatively) Build Docker image
- build 0net image: `docker build -t 0net-conservancy:latest . -f Dockerfile`
- or build 0net image with integrated tor: `docker build -t 0net-conservancy:latest . -f Dockerfile.integrated_tor`
- and run it: `docker run --rm -it -v </path/to/0n/data/directory>:/app/data -p 43110:43110 -p 26552:26552 0net-conservancy:latest`
- /path/to/0n/data/directory - directory, where all data will be saved, including your secret certificates. If you run it with production mode, do not remove this folder!
- or you can run it with docker-compose: `docker compose up -d 0net-conservancy` up two containers - 0net and tor separately.
- or: `docker compose up -d 0net-tor` for run 0net and tor in one container.
(please check if these instructions are still accurate)

#### (alternatively) Linux one-liner installation and updating

After installing [System dependencies](#system-dependencies) you can run following command for installation and update:

> zndir="$HOME/zeronetc" ; if [[ ! -d "$zndir" ]]; then git clone --recursive "https://github.com/zeronet-conservancy/zeronet-conservancy.git" "$zndir" && cd "$zndir"||exit; else cd "$zndir";git pull origin main; fi; cd "$zndir" && /usr/bin/python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && echo -e ""$zndir"/venv/bin/python3 "$zndir"/zeronet.py \\"\\$@\\"" > zeronet.sh && chmod +x zeronet.sh && echo -e "\nRun on a desktop PC: $(pwd)/zeronet.sh --no-migrate\nRun on a headless http://server:8081 : $(pwd)/zeronet.sh --ui-ip \\"*\\" --ui-port 8081 --no-migrate\nShow command help using parameter --help"

To keep Zeronet always running on a desktop PC, run following command being in a Zeronet directory:
> echo -e "$(crontab -l 2>/dev/null)\n* * * * * $(whoami) pgrep -if 'eronet\.(py|sh)' || $(pwd)/zeronet.sh --no-migrate &" | crontab -

On a headless server, you can add parameters like `--ui-ip "*" --ui-port 8081` to access UI via http://server:8081. Zeronet should automatically start every minute in case it is not running. To edit the task, run `crontab -e`.

#### Alternative script
 - after installing general dependencies and cloning repo (as above),
   run `start-venv.sh` which will create a virtual env for you and
   install python requirements
 - more convenience scripts to be added soon

### (unofficial) Windows OS build

Download and extract .zip archive
[zeronet-conservancy-0.7.10-unofficial-win64.zip](https://github.com/zeronet-conservancy/zeronet-conservancy/releases/download/v0.7.10/zeronet-conservancy-0.7.10-unofficial-win64.zip)

### Building under Windows OS

(These instructions are work-in-progress, please help us test it and improve it!)

- install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- install some windows compiler suitable for python , this proved to be the most difficult part for me as non-windows user (see here https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers and i'll link more references later)
- [optionally to get latest dev version] install git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
- [optionally to use tor for better connectivity and anonymization] install tor browser from https://www.torproject.org/download/
- open git bash console
- type/copypaste `git clone https://github.com/zeronet-conservancy/zeronet-conservancy.git` into command line
- wait till git downloads latest dev version and continue in console
- `cd zeronet-conservancy`
- `python -m venv venv` (create virtual python environment)
- `venv\Scripts\activate` (this activates the environment)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (install python dependencies) (some users reported that this command doesn't successfully install requirements and only manual installation of dependencies one by one works)
- (NOTE: if previous step fails, it most likely means you haven't installed c/c++ compiler successfully)
- [optional for tor for better connectivity and anonymity] launch Tor Browser
- (NOTE: windows might show a window saying it blocked access to internet for "security reasons" — you should allow the access)
- `python zeronet.py --tor_proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 --tor_controller 127.0.0.1:9151` (launch zeronet-conservancy!)
- [for full tor anonymity launch this instead] `python zeronet.py --tor_proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 --tor_controller 127.0.0.1:9151 --tor always`
- navigate to http://127.0.0.1:43110 in your favourite browser!

To build .exe

- follow the same steps as above, but additionally
- `pip install pyinstaller`
- `pyinstaller -p src -p plugins --hidden-import merkletools --hidden-import lib.bencode_open --hidden-import Crypt.Crypt --hidden-import Db.DbQuery --hidden-import lib.subtl --hidden-import lib.subtl.subtl --hidden-import sockshandler --add-data "src;src" --add-data "plugins;plugins" --clean zeronet.py`
- dist/zeronet should contain working zeronet.exe!

## Current limitations

* File transactions are not compressed
* No private sites
* No DHT support
* No I2P support
* Centralized elements like zeroid (we're working on this!)
* No reliable spam protection (and on this too)
* Doesn't work directly from browser (one of the top priorities for mid-future)
* No data transparency
* No reproducible builds
* No on-disk encryption
* No reproducible builds (hence no builds beyond certain GNU/Linux distributions)


## How can I create a ZeroNet site?

 * Click on **⋮** > **"Create new, empty site"** menu item on the [dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:43110/191CazMVNaAcT9Y1zhkxd9ixMBPs59g2um/).
 * You will be **redirected** to a completely new site that is only modifiable by you!
 * You can find and modify your site's content in **data/[yoursiteaddress]** directory
 * After the modifications open your site, drag the topright "0" button to the left, then press **sign and publish** button on the bottom

## Help this project stay alive

### Become a maintainer

We need more maintainers! Become one today! You don't need to know how to code,
there's a lot of other work to do.

### Make builds for your platforms

We need reproducible stand-alone builds for major platforms, as well as presense in various FLOSS
repositories. If you're using one of Linux distributions which don't have packages yet, why not make
a package for it or (if you don't know how) ask a maintainer now?

### Fix bugs & add features

We've decided to go ahead and make a perfect p2p web, so we need more help
implementing it.

### Make your site/bring your content

We know the documentation is lacking, but we try our best to support anyone
who wants to migrate. Don't hesitate to ask.

### Use it and spread the word

Make sure to tell people why do you use 0net and this fork in particular! People
need to know their alternatives.

### Financially support maintainers

# We're using GitHub under protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free/Libre and Open Souce Software
(FLOSS). We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FLOSS project. We have an
[open issue](https://github.com/zeronet-conservancy/zeronet-conservancy/issues/89)
to track moving away from GitHub in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, feel
free to [check out from our mirror on notabug](https://notabug.org/caryoscelus/zeronet-conservancy)
and develop there or send git patches directly to project maintainer via
preffered [contact channel](https://caryoscelus.github.io/contacts/).

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission. We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
